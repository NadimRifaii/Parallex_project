            Superman is an alien from the planet Krypton who was sent to Earth as a baby by his parents just before
            Krypton was
            destroyed. He was raised by a farm couple in Smallville, Kansas, and learned to use his superpowers for
            good.
            As an
            adult, he moved to the city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet while also
            protecting the
            city as Superman.
